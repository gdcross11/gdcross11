## Hi there 👋

As a data analyst with a growing portfolio in data science, I specialize in transforming health and policy data into insights that drive real-world impact. 

With almost 3 years of experience in SQL, Python, and applied analytics, I’ve led initiatives across complex data systems, collaborated across teams, and used data to support critical decisions in mental health and child welfare.

My technical toolkit includes Python (pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, NLTK), SQL, SAS, and XML. I’ve applied these tools to uncover health trends, build reproducible pipelines, and support cross-functional stakeholders with interpretable, ethical data products. I’ve also contributed to quality assurance and team development through peer review and cross-training in operations, enhancing my ability to work fluidly across teams. I'm experienced with Git/GitHub and JIRA for version control and agile ticketing in collaborative environments.

I’ve completed graduate-level coursework in machine learning and statistics, and have worked on personal and professional projects using regression, classification, and NLP techniques.

Colleagues often describe me as thoughtful, analytical, and calm under pressure. I bring both technical skills and a deep understanding of how data can support equity-centered outcomes. I’m particularly passionate about roles that integrate public health, policy, and applied data science—whether through research, predictive modeling, or system evaluation.

I’m currently preparing for a Ph.D. path in computational cognitive science and exploring data science roles where I can expand my impact and contribute to meaningful, measurable change. If you’re looking for a data scientist or analyst who brings both heart and rigor, I’d love to connect!
